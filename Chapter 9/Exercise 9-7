This is my attempt at solving Exercise 9-7.

I had lots of trouble getting the output for my program to match the output from the methods checker on Canvas.

I spent well over an hour wracking my brain as to what my problem was until I finally realized I put a "-" symbol
instead of a "+" symbol in the deposit() method. lol.
